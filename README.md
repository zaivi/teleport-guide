# Teleport - The Open Infrastructure Access Platform

## Teleport centralized control access across service

The open source access platform used by DevSecOps teams for SSH, Kubernetes, databases, internal web applications and Windows. Teleport prevents phishing by relying on biometrics and machine identity, stops attacker pivots with the Zero Trust architecture, is compatible with everything you have, comes as a cloud service or a self-hosted option and doesn't get in the way of an engineer's productivity.
